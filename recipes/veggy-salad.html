            <h3>What is Ceasar Salad</h3>
                <p>A Caesar salad is a crisp green salad with romaine lettuce, Parmesan cheese, and croutons, 
                    tossed in a tangy dressing made from olive oil, egg, garlic, lemon juice, Worcestershire 
                    sauce, and anchovies, often served as a starter or main with added chicken or shrimp. 
                      </p>
                <p>It was invented in Tijuana, Mexico, by Caesar Cardini around 1924, it's known for its rich, 
                    savory dressing and fresh, crunchy elements.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Romaine Lettuce</li>
                <li>Cherry Tomatoes</li>
                <li>Tid bits Bacon</li>
                <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>Crisp croutons</li>
                <li>Homemade Caesar Dressing</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps in Creating Ceasar Salad</h2>
            <h4>Preparing the Lettuce</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Rinse in Cold Water</strong> - keeping the lettuce cold will keep it crisp.</li>
                <li><strong>Start with Dry Leaves</strong> - use salad spinner then chop, rinse <br>
                    and spin dry (use salad spinner) the leaves to remove as much water as possible.<br>
                    It’s a major time-saver, and it does a better job of drying.</li>
                <li><strong>Chill Lettuce Before Using </strong> - Once the romaine is rinsed and dried, store it in an airtight container or a zip-top bag with a paper towel to absorb moisture.</li> 
            </ol>

            <h4>Make Croutons</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut the baguette in half lengthwise and slice into 1/4″ thick pieces and place on a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Combine 3 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil with minced garlic. Toss the croutons with garlic-infused oil and 2 Tbsp finely grated Parmesan.</li>
                <li> Spread them evenly onto the baking sheet and bake until crisp and golden at the edges. If you want to store these for later, bake until they are fully dried out.</li> 
            </ol>

             <h4>Plating the Ceasar Salad</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, add your prepared romaine lettuce, top with croutons and parmesan.</li>
                <li>Just before serving, drizzle with your dressing, and toss gently to coat the lettuce and croutons.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <h2>And you are done! Enjoy the Salad</h2>
